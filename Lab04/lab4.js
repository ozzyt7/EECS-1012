/**
 * Introduction to Computing: A Net-centric Approach

=== EECS Fall 2024 ===
Lassonde School of Engineering

=== Module Description ===
In this module we write some functions in that illustrate the use of loops (for
and while). We will also tie the execution of one function to the HTML DOM!

 * The second element in the array is the maximum number of Dimes that 
 * can be found in the number of cents, after the Quarters have been accounted for.

 * can be found in the number of cents, after the Quarters and Dimes have been accounted for.

 * Quarters, Nickels and Dimes have been accounted for.
 * For example, if the input is 65, the output should be:
 * [2,1,1,0]
 * This is because 65 cents can be formed with 2 quarters, 1 dime and 1 nickel.
